==================

PHP, MYSQL, Joomla Database Egg Catching

Current Function:
Reads Images from the server
Places Images on the screen at set locations
Causes Images to fade out and back in with a new image

Image fading is not in sync, meaning that the images all fade out and in at different times

Needed Functionality:
Syncronization 
    This needs to be syncronized, so that everyone viewing the page at that time is all showing the same thing

If an image is clicked by someone signed in:
   The image needs to fade out, and a new image needs to fade in
   Data needs to be sent to a table in the database that includes:
       A unique ID
       Path to the image on the server
       A name
       Who clicked the image
       When the image was clicked (date and time)
       Gender (random)
   The user who clicked it needs to be sent to a different webpage on the server
       The webpage they are sent to on the server needs to recieve a reference to the new entry in the database
      
If an image is clicked by someone who is not signed in:
    Nothing happens
    
If an image is clicked by two people:
    Only the first person who clicked it triggers the clicked functions
    The second person should get a pop-up that informs them that the image is "already fading into the mist"
    
The webpage can be accessed at: 71.145.242.147
This is not a fully hosted webpage, meaning that the page may be slow to load, or may not load at all your first couple of tries
If you choose to work on this project, you will recieve login information to the database and the server.
